# DATASCI-306-Final-Project
DATASCI 306 Final Project at the University of Michigan

This project is a web app created using Shiny R exploring how square feet and acres affect the price of housing in Ann Arbor based on distance from the city center. In addition, it allows users to explore how different variables affect housing in different regions of Ann Arbor and can even act as a house search on the houses sold in Ann Arbor from 2021 to 2025. To run it locally, you must download the code locally, open the code in RStudio or your favorite IDE that supports R, download all of the libraries used in the app (listed on the top), and get your API key from Stadiamaps. 

To get your API key from Stadiamaps, go to https://stadiamaps.com/, create an account, and follow the instructions below. Then, install the R library “usethis.” Once this is installed, run the command usethis::edit_r_environ(), and then type STADIA_KEY=... Replace the “...” with your API key with no quotation marks around it. Now, when you run the code, it should run locally on your machine with no issues.

Alternatively, you can head to this link: https://masonyoung314.shinyapps.io/DATASCI-306-Final-Project/ to run this app in your browser of choice!
